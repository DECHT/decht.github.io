    <h1>Was damals geschah</h1>
    <h2>C&H-Theme for Wallaby</h2>
    <p>Creates a Docker-Container with Ubuntu 21,
        installs OpenStack,
        exchanges the theme files and adds some add-ons.
    </p>

    <p>Now our OpenStack Dashboard has a new blue theme,
        there are some little changes in functionality,
        eg. the password resetting fuction provided by OpenStack is disabled. </p>

    <h2>Password Reset for Wallaby</h2>
    <p>The most work was done by Dag last year,
        I just changed the theme into blue
        and fixed some bugs.

    <h2>P.S.</h2>
    <p>I did not spend much time on the documentary, because I did not know, whether my work will be used one day.
        So feel free to give me feedbacks.</p>
